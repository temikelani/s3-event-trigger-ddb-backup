# Automating DynamoDB Backups Via S3 Event Trigggers Using Lambda Functions <a id ='top'></a>

<br><br>

## Summary

- You have a dynamodb table and an s3 bucket.
- And for you want the dynamodb table to be backed up whenever you upload a file to s3.
- You also want an email notification sent when the backup is complete

# Objective <a id='obj'></a> ([go to top](#top))

- Automate - using a lambda script - the backup of a ddb table
- Upload a file to s3, and trigger a backup to aws backup
- Send a notification

<br>
<br>
<br>

# Steps <a id='steps'></a> ([go to top](#top))

- Setup Your environment
  - Deploy the [Cloud Formation Template](0-setup/setup-env-cfn.yaml)
  - Upload the [order_data.csv](./0-setup/order_data.csv) to the s3 bucket created
- create an `SNS Topic` and `email subscription`
- Create a `Lambda function` to create a dynamodb table backup
- Add an s3 `s3:ObjectCreated:*` notification trigger to that function with the required lambda permission
- Create a role for the lambda function to
  - create, list and delete DynamoDB backups
  - Publish to SNS topics
  - with the right trust relationship document to allow lambda assume the role
- Upload a file to s3 and test your function
- Update the existing stack with the cloud formation template [solution-cfn.yaml](./1-via-cloud-formation/solution-cfn.yaml) then upload a
  file to S3 to test the backup process.
